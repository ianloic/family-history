# Family History
Dumping ground for notes and documents about my family history

I'm maintaining the [actual tree](http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/33182929/family) on Ancestry for lack of a better option.

I'm collecting resources, largly out of print books from archive.org in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bxxm9-fYAiDadVNMN25rY0VCUnM).
